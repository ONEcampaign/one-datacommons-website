        <h2 class="section__heading">What are The Climate Finance Files?</h2>
        <div class="section__content">
            <p>The Climate Finance Files are a collection of data and tools on international public climate finance.</p>
            <p>We think is the best (or more accurately, least worst) publicly available data on international public
                climate
                finance. Our data isn&#39;t perfect, because the data coming from providers is flawed. But we&#39;ve
                done our
                best to apply a standardised and transparent methodology so that the data is comparable across providers
                and
                minimises over-counting. To learn more about our methodological choices, <a
                        href="https://observablehq.com/@one-campaign/the-climate-finance-files-methodology">read
                    this</a>.</p>
            <p>The Climate Finance Files look specifically at international public financial support for climate change
                adaptation and mitigation.</p>
            <p>As part of this work, we are releasing tools to more easily extract, clean, and work with the data
                reported to
                UNFCCC and the OECD, without relying on the many individual spreadsheets and databases where it is
                currently
                stored.</p>
            <p>We are also making clean versions of the data available for others to analyse. This should meaningfully
                lower the
                barriers to access that many organisations face when seeking to conduct research or advocacy on these
                topics.</p>

        <h2 class="section__heading">Why are we releasing new climate finance data?</h2>
        <div class="section__content">
            <p>Climate finance data is notoriously difficult to access and understand. The different reporting systems,
                methodologies, sources, and types of finance can make it hard to provide straightforward answers to key
                questions.</p>
            <p>We started this work to quantify annual climate finance contributions by specific countries. But asking a
                question as simple as &quot;How much does France spend on mitigation and adaptation in developing
                countries?&quot;
                raised a myriad of questions: According to which source? Commitments or disbursements? Grants or loans?
                ODA or
                other official flows? Bilaterally or multilaterally... and so on.</p>
            <p>Finding answers to these questions isn&#39;t easy. Different organisations have different motivations for
                how
                they report and present this data. And analysing climate finance in a robust way requires going back to
                messy
                and complex raw data.</p>
            <p>We realise that many organisations have a strong track record of analysing climate finance data. We have
                learnt a
                lot from that work.</p>
            <p>But we think that <strong>accessing clean, comparable data on climate finance should be much easier than
                it is now.</strong></p>
