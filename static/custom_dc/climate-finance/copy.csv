,intro,1,These are the human and economic impacts of just a few extreme weather events in Africa. ,
,intro,1,More are coming. ,
,intro,1,"Despite that reality, industrialised countries — historically the world’s largest carbon emitters — are doing too little to help climate-vulnerable countries prepare for a climate-changed future. Adding insult to injury, these high-income countries make it incredibly difficult to accurately track how much they’re actually contributing and where it’s spent. That’s because reporting has been confusing, slow, and imprecise. ",
,intro,1,"As a result, no one knows with certainty how much money has been promised, much less delivered.",
,intro,2,"To change that, we’ve launched the Climate Finance Files. They reveal in unprecedented detail how much governments and international institutions are spending to support climate-vulnerable countries. ",The Climate Finance Files apply a robust methodology to correct flaws in the OECD's and UNFCCC's data.
,intro,2,Spoiler: They are spending far less than they claim. And orders of magnitude less than what’s needed.,
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,3,Climate finance accounting is a mess. You get different numbers wherever you look.,
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,3,"That’s because donor countries and international financial institutions (we’ll refer to them as “providers”) decide for themselves what is and isn’t climate finance. There are no standardised reporting rules, guidelines, or definitions. So depending on who’s counting, you can get drastically different numbers.",
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,4,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which tracks and reports official development assistance, <a href=""https://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/climate-change.htm"">often counts</a> all projects that have a climate component — regardless of how tiny — as 100% climate finance. You don’t need a maths degree to guess what happens: significantly inflated climate finance numbers. ",
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,4,"Data reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) — the official body tasked with collecting the data — is meant to reduce overcounting. But as the chart below shows, reporting methodologies vary significantly, and only a few countries attempt to count and report the actual climate portion of a project. Most providers count a fixed percentage, for instance, 40% or 50%. Some even count the entire cost of a project as climate finance, even if only a small portion of it is climate-related.",
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,5,"Those decisions can substantially impact climate finance figures. To illustrate, we apply Germany and Switzerland’s methodologies to a bundle of projects reported by the UK to the UNFCCC. Under this scenario, Germany would report one-third less in climate finance than the UK reports. Switzerland would report 21% less. ",
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,5,"The OECD, meanwhile, would inflate the total by 50%. ",
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,6,"It gets worse. No one is providing a full reporting on how much of this money actually gets spent (ahem, until now). ",
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,6,"The current climate finance reporting system suffers from many other flaws: Messy data, like grouping recipient countries together, using the wrong currency, and stating billions instead of millions. A lack of timely reporting — often only once every two years! And wildly confusing methods for tracking spending via multilateral institutions. There are too many flaws to detail them all here (which is why we wrote this more in-depth piece LINK TO BE ADDED). But they make climate finance from the UNFCCC and OECD incomplete, misleading, and incomparable.",
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,7,"The lack of standardised reporting rules invariably results in other forms of creative accounting. Should financing a coal-fired power plant be considered climate finance? If you’re Japan, the answer is repeatedly yes. Should financing a hotel? The US thinks so. A chocolate shop? If you’re shaking your head no, Italy would like a word. What about renovating a port (France), outfitting police (Italy), or fighting terrorism (the EU and Italy)? ",
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,7,"A UK announcement in October 2023 perfectly illustrates the absurdity of letting providers decide what counts toward their climate finance targets, with no standardised process or oversight. The UK plans to broaden its definition of climate finance so it can take credit for providing more climate finance without actually providing any more money. ",
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,7,"Who benefits from such a system? Certainly not the millions of people on the frontlines of climate change who are losing their homes, their livelihoods, and even their lives.",
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,7,It doesn’t need to be this way. Incredible progress in our ability to track and share complex data means that we have the ability to track — with precision — every dollar being spent on climate finance. Not doing so is a political choice. And it’s one that must change. ,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,8,"Industrialised countries are doing the bare minimum to help vulnerable countries deal with the climate crisis. In 2021, they claimed to have contributed US$89.6 billion. That may seem close to the (low) bar they set for themselves in 2009: to provide US$100 billion in annual climate finance to climate vulnerable countries. ",
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,8,"But that number is almost certainly inflated. Meanwhile, those same countries collectively spent 14 times as much (US$1.2 trillion) on their militaries that year.",
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,9,"They might meet the US$100 billion goal in 2023 — but they have already short-changed the problem by billions of promised dollars. And because of the lack of transparent, standardised, and easily accessible data, those figures obscure the real story.",
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,9,Rich countries are providing much less climate finance than they claim,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,9,The Climate Finance Files reveal that providers are committing and delivering less climate finance than they claim. ,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,9,A lot less. ,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,9,"Climate finance commitments from donor countries and international institutions are vastly overstated. Two-thirds of climate finance commitments counted by the OECD are never reported as disbursed or didn’t have much to do with climate to begin with. Between 2013 and 2021, that’s an eye-popping US$400 billion.",
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,9,Let’s break that down. ,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,9,The OECD’s reported total climate finance commitments for all providers between 2013 and 2021 are much higher than they actually are. Nearly $1 in every $5 of climate finance commitments in the OECD’s open dataset between 2013 and 2021 isn’t really climate finance. That’s worth US$125 billion — money supposedly earmarked for climate but instead spent on things that have little or nothing to do with climate,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,10,Providers are also reporting far less in disbursements than they’re committing to deliver. ,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,10,"Bilateral providers, for instance, disbursed less than half of the climate finance they committed between 2013 and 2021, a difference of US$135 billion.",
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,11,These reporting discrepancies can be considerable and consequential. ,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,11,"France, for instance, claimed credit for allocating 131% (US$22 billion) more in climate finance between 2013 and 2021 than it actually disbursed. Germany claimed to spend 114% (US$34 billion) more than it really did. ",
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,11,"Some providers — including many multilateral institutions — don't report disbursement data at all, making it impossible to accurately track. As such, these numbers are incomplete, highlighting the poor state of climate finance reporting.",
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,11,"Without an accurate picture of how much providers are contributing, recipient countries are left in the dark, unable to accurately plan or budget for climate projects.",
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,11,"Nigeria, for instance, received 317% (US$4.9 billion) less in climate finance between 2013 and 2021 than it was promised. Senegal received 185% (US$3 billion) less, and Kenya 120% (US$5.2 billion) less. ",
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,11,Bad data makes it virtually impossible to hold providers accountable for their climate pledges and responsibilities. ,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,11,It also breeds distrust. ,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,11,"Given a history littered with broken commitments and perceived donor country hypocrisy, climate-vulnerable countries are losing trust in both climate finance data and donors’ intentions to meet their commitments. Reestablishing that trust will be crucial for negotiations over a new climate finance target for 2025 and beyond, (which someone, who clearly lacks a marketing background, named “the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance”).",
Climate finance isn’t going where it’s needed most,misallocation,12,The world’s most climate-vulnerable countries aren’t getting the climate finance they need.  ,
Climate finance isn’t going where it’s needed most,misallocation,12,The world’s 20 most climate-vulnerable countries received a total of US$1.8 billion in climate finance disbursements in 2021. That’s just 7% of the US$24.3 billion they need each year to address climate change.,
Climate finance isn’t going where it’s needed most,misallocation,13,"Cash-strapped countries are being forced to choose between taking steps to curb their own emissions (“mitigation”) and adapt to climate change (“adaptation”), or invest in other pressing priorities, like feeding, caring for, and educating their people. Let’s look at health spending as an example.",
Climate finance isn’t going where it’s needed most,misallocation,13,"[NOT] Nigeria’s domestic government spending on health in 2020 accounted for just 0.5% of GDP (US$2.2 billion), far below the recommended 5% of GDP. That’s despite being Africa’s most populous country and its largest oil producer. Meanwhile, the country needs US$17.7 billion in climate finance per year to implement a green energy transition and adapt to climate change. Yet the country received a mere US$335 million in climate finance from international providers in 2021.",
Climate finance isn’t going where it’s needed most,misallocation,14,"These countries, in effect, are experiencing negative net climate finance flows. Cash-strapped countries are being forced to choose between taking steps to curb their own emissions (“mitigation”) and adapt to climate change (“adaptation”), meet their debt service obligations, or invest in other pressing priorities, like feeding, caring for, and educating their people. Let’s look at health spending as an example.",
Debt payments often outstrip climate finance,debt cominance,15,"But wait, there’s more: Money is actually flowing out of many debt-distressed countries. That’s because many countries with severe debt problems are paying more to service their debt each year than they receive in climate finance. ",
Debt payments often outstrip climate finance,debt cominance,15,"Of the 46 (out of 54) countries with severe debt problems for which we have debt payment data, 22 paid more in debt payments to lenders between 2019 and 2021 than they received in climate finance. Nine of those countries are in Africa.",
Debt payments often outstrip climate finance,debt cominance,16,"These countries, in effect, are experiencing negative net climate finance flows. ",
Debt payments often outstrip climate finance,debt cominance,16,"The majority of climate finance providers are guilty of perpetuating this problem. Between 2019 and 2021, 29 out of 44 providers received more in debt payments from countries with severe debt problems than they provided in climate finance to those same countries. ",
Debt payments often outstrip climate finance,debt cominance,16,"To make matters worse, much of the climate finance those heavily indebted countries receive is in the form of new debt.",
Debt payments often outstrip climate finance,debt cominance,16,More than half (58%) of all climate finance disbursed to the 54 countries with severe debt problems between 2019 and 2021 were in the form of loans. More than $1 in every $4 of climate finance for those countries was a non-concessional loan. That risks deepening those countries’ debt problems and jeopardising their ability to meet their citizens’ needs and tackle climate change in the long run.,
Debt payments often outstrip climate finance,debt cominance,16,Piling climate debt onto heavily-indebted countries is climate malpractice. Yet that is precisely what providers are doing in many cases when it comes to the types of climate finance they are providing. See for yourself in the data below.,
Why this matters,implications,17,"Climate change could push more than 132 million additional people into extreme poverty by the end of the decade. By 2050, more than 1.6 billion people – including nearly 20% of Africa’s population – could be exposed to severe droughts. That’s a 400% increase from today. ",
Why this matters,implications,17,"Everyone, everywhere is better off if climate-vulnerable countries get the help they need to build resilient economies, infrastructure, and social safety nets. To prevent millions of people from falling into poverty. To avoid countless, costly humanitarian crises and conflicts. To avert future carbon emissions. To make the world more peaceful and prosperous. ",
Why this matters,implications,17,Ensuring those countries get the support they need requires accurate tracking of climate finance flows.,
A plan for climate action,plan,18,Fighting climate change is hard. Monitoring the actions we’re taking to fight climate change shouldn’t be. A world in which we can ensure that climate-vulnerable countries have the resources they need to prepare for a climate-changed future is within our grasp. ,
A plan for climate action,plan,18,We just need to seize it. Here’s how.,
