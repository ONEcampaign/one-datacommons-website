,intro,1,More are coming.,,
,intro,2,"Despite that reality, ¶industrialised countries¶ — historically the world’s largest carbon emitters — are doing too little to help climate-vulnerable countries prepare for a climate-changed future. Adding insult to injury, these high-income countries make it incredibly difficult to accurately track how much money they’re actually contributing and where it’s being spent. That’s because reporting has been confusing, slow, and imprecise.",,"[""Countries where industrial production is a large share of economic activity or gross domestic product (GDP). For example, the US, Australia or France.""]"
,intro,2,"As a result, no one knows with certainty how much actual climate finance has been committed, much less delivered.",,
,intro,3,"To change that, we’ve launched The Climate Finance Files. They reveal in unprecedented detail how much governments and international institutions are spending to support climate-vulnerable countries.",The Files apply a robust methodology to correct flaws in the existing data,
,intro,3,Spoiler: They are spending far less than they claim. And orders of magnitude less than what’s needed.,,
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,4,Climate finance accounting is a mess. You get different numbers wherever you look.,,
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,4,"That’s because donor countries and international financial institutions (we’ll refer to them as “providers”) decide for themselves what is and isn’t climate finance. There are no standardised reporting rules, guidelines, or definitions that apply across all providers. So depending on who’s counting, you can get drastically different numbers.",,
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,5,"Data reported to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which tracks and reports official flows like ¶0aid¶, uses the ¶1Rio Markers¶ to track climate finance in the Climate-related ¶2Development Finance dataset¶. That approach <a href=""https://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/climate-change.htm"" target=""_blank"">counts all projects</a> that have a climate component — regardless of how small — as 100% climate finance.

Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,5,"Data reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) — the official body tasked with collecting the data — is meant to reduce overcounting. But as the chart below shows, providers’ reporting methodologies vary significantly, and only a few countries attempt to count and report the actual climate portion of a project. Most providers start with the Rio Markers and either count 100% of the project costs (if climate is its main purpose) or count a fixed percentage, for instance, 40% or 50% (if climate is one, but not the main, purpose). That means 40% (and sometimes more) of a project’s cost could be counted as climate, even if there is only a small focus on climate change.",,
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,6,"Those decisions can substantially impact climate finance figures. To illustrate, we apply the methodologies that Germany and Switzerland use to a randomly selected bundle of projects reported by the UK to the UNFCCC. For the same projects, Germany would report one-third less in climate finance than the UK reports. Switzerland would report 21% less.",,
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,6,"If reported to the OECD using the Rio Markers, meanwhile, the total would be inflated by 50%.",,
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,7,"It gets worse. ¶No one is providing¶ clear reporting on how much of this money actually gets spent (ahem, until now that is. More on that below).",,"[""This isn't for lack of trying by many well-intentioned people.""]"
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,7,"The current climate finance reporting system suffers from many other flaws: Messy data, like grouping recipient countries together, using the wrong currency, and stating billions instead of millions. A lack of timely reporting — some data gets published <a href=""https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/e20d2bc7-en.pdf?expires=1700703529&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=5676CCEB856EFC926D4DD8E42DAD6FEA"" target=""_blank"">four years later</a>!

Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,8,"<i>Who benefits from such a system?</i> Certainly not the millions of people on the frontlines of climate change who are losing their homes, their livelihoods, and even their lives.",,
Welcome to the climate finance “Wild West”,messy data,8,It doesn’t need to be this way. Incredible progress in our ability to track and share complex data means that we have the ability to track — with precision — every dollar being spent on climate finance. Not doing so is a political choice. And it’s one that must change.,,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,9,"Industrialised countries are doing the bare minimum to help developing countries deal with the climate crisis.

Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,11,A lot less. ,,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,11,"Climate finance ¶0commitments¶ are <b>vastly</b> overstated. <b>Nearly two-thirds</b> of climate finance commitments ¶1counted¶ by the OECD are never reported as ¶2disbursed¶ or didn’t have much to do with climate to begin with.

At least $1 in every $5 of climate finance commitments in the OECD’s open dataset between 2013 and 2021 —  worth US$115 billion — is counted as if it were ¶1exclusively¶ related to climate.

Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,13,"The OECD (or its members) choose to present this data as “commitments,” instead of analysing how much is actually disbursed. That’s problematic because providers systematically disburse less money than they commit.",,"[""A 'firm' obligation to provide financing to a certain country or institutions for specified purposes.""]"
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,13,Only 49% of the climate finance committed by ¶bilateral providers¶ between 2013 and 2021 was reported as disbursed or was meaningfully related to climate.

Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,14,These reporting discrepancies can be considerable and consequential. ,,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,14,"For instance, between 2013 and 2021, France reported disbursements for only 43% of what it claimed credit for when reporting climate finance commitments to the OECD (a difference of US$22 billion). Germany reported disbursing only 47% of its commitments (US$34 billion less).",,
Providers keep breaking their promises,promises,14,"Some ¶multilateral institutions¶ don't report disbursement data at all to the OECD, making it difficult (and sometimes impossible) to accurately track.

Climate finance isn’t going where it’s needed most,misallocation,17,It gets worse: Money is actually flowing <b>out</b> of many ¶debt-distressed¶ countries.

That risks deepening those countries’ debt problems and jeopardising their ability to meet their citizens’ needs and tackle climate change in the long run,,"[""Loans at, or close to, market rates.""]"
Debt payments often outstrip climate finance,debt cominance,18,Piling climate debt onto already heavily-indebted countries – particularly if it’s non-concessional – is climate malpractice.
